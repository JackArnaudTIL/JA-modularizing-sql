# Legacy SQL to Modularized dbt Demo

## Overview

Welcome to the **Legacy SQL to Modularized dbt Demo** repository. This repository is part of an internal upskilling session designed to demonstrate the benefits of modularizing SQL code using dbt. The repository includes two key branches:

- **`main` branch:** Contains a starter legacy SQL script that represents how code might be written in a non-modular, monolithic way.
- **`modularized` branch:** Contains a refactored version of the legacy SQL script, where the code has been modularized to demonstrate best practices in dbt.

## Purpose

The goal of this demo is to highlight the advantages of modularizing SQL code, specifically:

- **DRY Code (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Modularized code reduces redundancy by reusing common logic across different parts of the project.
- **Version Control:** With modularized code, multiple team members can work on separate branches without conflicts, making collaboration smoother.
- **Readability:** Modular code is easier to read, understand, and maintain, especially for new team members or those inheriting the project.
- **Unit Testing:** Modular components can be individually tested, making it easier to write unit tests and isolate issues.

## Getting Started

1. **Explore the `main` branch:**
   - Review the legacy SQL script to understand how the code was originally structured.
   
2. **Switch to the `modularized` branch:**
   - Explore the refactored, modularized version of the same code.
   - Notice how the logic has been broken down into smaller, reusable components.

## How to Use

- **Internal Training:** This repository was designed for use as part of an upskilling session. Feel free to experiment with the code, make changes, and observe how modularization can simplify your SQL workflows.
- **Demo:** During the session, we'll walk through the process of refactoring the legacy SQL script into a modular structure using dbt.

## Contributions

This repository is intended for educational purposes only, and contributions are not necessary. However, if you have suggestions for improving the demo, feel free to reach out.
